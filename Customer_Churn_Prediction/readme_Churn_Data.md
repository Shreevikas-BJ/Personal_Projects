# Customer Churn Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning project to predict customer churn using logistic regression. This project walks through end-to-end data handling: cleaning, exploration, modeling, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

Predict whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service) based on their demographic and usage behavior.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Features include customer demographics, account information, and services subscribed.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📊 Workflow

1. **Load the Dataset**
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values
   - Drop irrelevant columns (like customer ID)
3. **Feature Encoding**
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical format
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize churn distribution
   - Analyze feature correlations
5. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Classification report
   - Accuracy score
